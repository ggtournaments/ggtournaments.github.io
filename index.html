                    Started in 2019 by Jerid Roberson, GGTournaments aims to offer a new way to run and manage gaming
                    tournaments. This is an Esports event app(IOS/Android) that allows users to create and RSVP to local
                    gaming tournaments from titles you can follow such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Overwatch and many
                    more. Overall we want to make the process of creating a tournament easy with all resources needed in
                    one app as well as let gamers battle to their hearts content. We also want to help smaller venues/
                    esport players gain more exposure to get to the next level.
